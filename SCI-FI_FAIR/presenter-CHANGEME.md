_The standard equipment is a table with a power strip. We can provide a MONITOR if needed (specify it now so we can rent one).

N/A - if you must have an visual I can try to hack one...

# Any other QUESTIONS or SUGGESTIONS?
_for sensitive concerns please email arkadiy [at] protocol.ai_
I work with Women Who Code and a part of my job is to help other devs learn more about AI and how it might affect their work. Felt like this would be a cool way to do that!
